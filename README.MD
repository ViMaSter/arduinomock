# Arduino mock library

One-file include mock library that supplies the compiler with the required definitions to compile code that should be run on an Arduino inside other IDEs.

This library is not "smart" and does not emulate functionality of an Arduino and only ensures compilation. Runtime functionality is not guaranteed.
